## 🧠 Problem Statement
Despite increasing awareness, mental health remains a stigmatized and under-addressed issue in tech workplaces. Many employees are unaware of or reluctant to use available resources, and employers often lack clear strategies to support mental wellness. This project seeks to analyze survey responses to highlight trends and barriers related to mental health in the tech industry.
